I am a PhD student of Computational Spatial Epidemiology at <a href = "https://www.mak.ac.ug"> <b>Makerere University</b></a>, one of Africa's premier universities, based in Kampala Uganda.
<br><br>
The goal of Computational Spatial Epidemiology is to develop and use computational methods to understand spatial dynamics of disease. In the current study we are investigating how machine learning (particularly deep learning) and data science methods may be used to model and analyze spatial disease patterns in a developing country setting. 

<br>To this end, we are integrating diverse data sources to understand spatial variability in human infectious disease including data on housing density (satellite imagery as proxy), socio-economic well-being, energy sources, and population mobility (mobile phone data as proxy).
